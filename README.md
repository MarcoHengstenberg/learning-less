# Learning To Write LESS Using Grunt

## Before We Dive In

First of all this is a course for the more experienced CSS people out there, who want to give preprocessors like LESS or SASS a try. It is not made for beginners. I'm letting you judge whether you are a beginner or amateur or a pro.

If you are on a Windows machine this guide will become helpful *after* the setup section. Unfortunately, I have not yet tried to work with LESS on a Windows Computer. There are [guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=te5i_CIC9Po) around the web though and I hope they might help you getting up and running with LESS. Sorry for the inconvenience but talking about stuff I am not 100% sure of how it works out for you is something I do not want to do. I want to solve problems, not create some.

## I Don't Need No Stinkin' Preprocessors

You have mastered CSS! You are one of those people on the web, that can bend the way HTML is displayed. For you *"[There is no spoon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzm8kTIj_0M)"*. That's great. I have been there myself and then someone told me:"Hey, you could be even better and faster by using a preprocessor like LESS or SASS." Initially, I frowned.

Why would I want to put a level of abstraction on the way I write code? Wait what – programming in my CSS? Variables? Are you insane? I have to use the Command Line (which is dangerous, I know that from hearing people whispering about HD crashes and stuff), Ruby and Javascript is somehow involved as well?

Yeah right, not interested. Go on and tell someone else about this. Someone who is more tech-savvy than I am. Variables in my CSS, bah, humbug!

## Curiosity is a Killer

But then I became intrigued. More and more people around the web were talking about how their workflow improved, how initial setups for frontend development or web design work would be a breeze or how separating a single CSS file into many different parts and merge them later on would reduce the time *searching for that one selector on line – what was it again – oh my.*

Alright, this preprocessor thingy seems not that bad after all, **let's do this**. Only once, just trying a little and then I go back to my nice, cozy and warm CSS-world.

## To Be Honest

I am trying as hard as I can to make this a valuable experience but this mission won't be accomplished without proper feedback. So, after asking my friends and my mother to take a look and all of them were saying:"That's so sweet, Marco. What is it?" I ask for honest feedback from the community.

Yes, I know, the trolls amongst you will already see the WIN in this and how tempting it is to crush this poor soul with soaring flames and make him weep in tears after you tore apart his precious creation. To give you a stop: I don't need that, I have a wife and two daughters.

What I'm asking for is proper criticism. Please feel free to get back to me anytime and I will try to answer your questions, consider your feedback and correct failures pointed out.

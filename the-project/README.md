# The Project

As we want to dive in and work on something, we sure need a project. Some HTML and a few folders should do the job.

In order to go on with this course clone [this repository](https://github.com/MarcoKunz/learning-less-the-project) to your computer. Or fork it. Or create a branch after forking and work on that. Or whatever suits you best.

It is mandatory to do that. You won't be able to go on with this course if you don't. Believe me, there is no surprise trojan or virus inside.

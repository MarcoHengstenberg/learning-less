## What Do We Have Here?

Now that the repo is on your computer, take a look around.

We have a wonderful `index.html` file with some content to style, we have a less folder, a css folder (both seemingly empty apart from a `.gitkeep`) and two files we have never ever seen before. `gruntfile.js` and `package.json` (both empty, too). Finally, there is an images folder with some images inside.

### The Index.html

The HTML Document is written in wonderful HTML5-goodness. In the head section you will find two commented <link> tags. You will have to uncomment one of them later on and I'll let you decide which one. It won't make much of a difference designwise but the filesize will differ significantly. Promised!

**Reminder:** it is always good to have an uncompressed version of anything you are writing, whether it is CSS or JS or HTML or whatever. Debugging is much easier with unminified sources. The compressed ones are for the live-server.

### Those Folders

The names are speaking for themselves and as expected we will create our LESS files in the less directory and put the CSS files in the CSS directory. It's that simple.

### That Gruntfile And Package.json

The Gruntfile, together with the package.json file, is where the magic happens.

The package.json defines what tasks we want to use and the gruntfile tells those tasks, how to do what they are good at. Dead simple as well.

### The Images

All images in the project are either created by myself or attributed. Credits are very important to me. You should never forget to give credit where it's due! NEVER! EVER!

# The Depencies

Here a short overview of the tools/depencies we are going to install. This will seem like a lot and be assured that even I don't know what some of them are really capable of. All I know is that I need them installed to work the way I love and that the convenience they bring outlasts the anxiety you feel in the beginning.

## [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a package manager. It will install complementing stuff for OSX. A more complete documentation than just these two sentences can be found on [Git](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).

## XCode

You only need its Command Line Tools to be installed for this course but it comes quite handy if you decided to develop an app later on or to have a variety of virtual devices to test your site during development.

## [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) coming with node to install Grunt and it is capable of doing so much more.

## [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com)

Grunt is a task runner easing your workflow while developing for the web.

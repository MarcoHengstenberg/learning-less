# The Depencies

Here a short overview of the tools/depencies we are going to install. This will seem like a lot and be assured that even I don't know what some of them are really capable of. All I know is that I need them installed to work the way I love.

### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a package manager. It will install complementing stuff for OSX.

### XCode

You only need its Command Line Tools to be installed for this course but it comes quite handy if you decided later on to develop an app.

### [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) coming with node to install Grunt and it is capable of doing so much more.

### [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com)

Grunt is a task runner easing your workflow while developing for the web.

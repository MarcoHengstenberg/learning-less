# The Setup

Before you dive in and start installing all the dependencies make sure you do not have some of them already on your machine.

Having XCode installed before everything else might not cause any problems. To install node.js from their website, then installing Homebrew from the Command Line and following this tutorial [WILL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12607155/error-the-brew-link-step-did-not-complete-successfully). Believe me! You do not want to end up with a scrambled install, it will make you do funny faces.

Ideally you would have a "clean OS". Meaning: *No* Homebrew! *No* node! *No* npm! *No* grunt! As this may not be the case simply take a look around for the different files on your Mac. If one of them is already installed, you might want to remove it again and start off fresh.

## Support

May be you have one or some of the dependencies installed and it will or won't create an issue on your machine with the rest of the pack â€“ I can't know that and I can't give proper support for this. Yet, from my experience, the community is very, very helpful and questions will be answered, issues solved and frowns will be turned into smiley-faces in no time.

Believe me, you'll be amazed. **Asking for help actually works!**

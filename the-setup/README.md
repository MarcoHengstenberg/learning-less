# The Setup

Before you dive in and start installing all the dependencies make sure you do not have some of them already on your machine. Having XCode installed before everything else might not cause any problems but to install node.js from their website, then installing Homebrew from the Command Line and following this tutorial [WILL](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12607155/error-the-brew-link-step-did-not-complete-successfully). Believe me! You do not want to end up with a scrambled install, it will make you do funny faces.

Ideally you would have a "clean OS". Meaning: No Homebrew, no node, no npm, no grunt. As this may not be the case simply take a look around for node.js on your Mac. If it is installed, you might want to remove it again and start off fresh.

Nothing found? Wonderful, let's move on.
